Description: The package contains methods to visualise the expression profile
    of genes from a microarray or RNA-seq experiment, and offers a 
    supervised clustering approach to identify GO terms enriched in genes
    with expression levels best clustering two or more predefined groups of
    samples. Annotations for the genes present in the expression dataset may 
    be obtained from Ensembl through the biomaRt package, if not provided by
    the user. The default random forest framework is used to evaluate the
    ability of each gene to cluster samples according to the
    factor of interest. Finally, GO terms are scored by averaging the
    rank (alternatively, score) of their respective gene sets to cluster
    the samples. P-values may be computed to assess the significance of GO
    term ranking. Visualisation function include gene expression profile,
    gene ontology-based heatmaps, and hierarchical clustering of 
    experimental samples using gene expression data.
